No guarantees to security here, but if you want an easy way to do bulk geocoding this site was really helpful. You have to enter your own Google Maps API keys, so I suggest setting some up in GCP that you can easily shut down when you're done. https://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/batch-geocode/

**Mapbox:** Mapbox is by far my favorite geo-taged visualization tool in PBI. You have to download it from the marketplace. It has limits without a subscription, but they aren't terribly restrictive. It's much more customizeable, if a little complex to get the hang of at first. You'll have to create an account with them and enter the credentials in the settings tab of the vizualization in PBI. The thing you'll want to get the hang of is creating custom styles and linking your vizualization to them in PBI. Doing so will allow you to do things like have a base layer of pinned locations in your vizualization (see below on QGis), or getting rid of superfluous layers like parks. The first step is importing your location info as a tileset. You can use QGis to generate shapefiles for free. Then you import the shapefiles to your map style and viola.


**QGis** is really helpful for creating your own shapefiles. I've used it in conjuction with MapBox to create awesome custom map visuals in PBI, for example with pins of competitor locations already set up on the base layer of a heatmap of our volumes. Here's a great blog explaining how to do this: https://community.pyramidanalytics.com/t/q5tk8w/creating-a-shapefile-using-latitude-and-longitude-coordinates

**Census Data:** If you need to download vectors for various administrative boundaries to create layers in your map, the census beaurau is really helpful. Especially, county boundaries are not a default option in mapbox. https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files.html If you use it in mapbox, you have to have the custom tileset loaded. Disable all but the chloropleth setting in visuzalization, and make sure you enter your tilesets address correctly as well as the layer name and attribute. Follow Mapbox's help files to the letter... I thought I was doing that and found I missed a small detail, so pay attention! https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/power-bi-choropleth-map/
